# Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

## Project Overview
The Customer Segmentation Analysis project aims to categorize customers into distinct groups based on their behaviors and characteristics. This segmentation allows businesses to tailor marketing strategies, improve customer service, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. The project uses clustering techniques to identify customer segments from historical data.

**Steps for Analysis**

Load the Data: Start by loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.

Data Exploration: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identify any missing values or outliers.

Data Cleaning: Clean the data by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting data types.

Feature Selection and Scaling: Select relevant features for segmentation and scale them to ensure they have similar ranges.

Clustering: Apply clustering algorithms (such as K-Means) to segment the customers into distinct groups.

Determine Optimal Number of Clusters: Use methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Cluster Profiling: Analyze and profile each cluster to understand its characteristics and behavior.

Visualization: Create visualizations to present the clustering results and the characteristics of each segment.


**Summary**

The Customer Segmentation Analysis project provides a comprehensive approach to categorizing customers into distinct groups. By following the steps outlined in this project, you can gain valuable insights into customer behaviors and characteristics, allowing for more targeted marketing strategies and improved customer service.
